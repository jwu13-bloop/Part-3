        <span> Asian bread is a style of bread commonly found in East Asian bakeries and is known for its soft, fluffy texture and slightly sweet taste. Western bread and Asian bread differ in texture, flavor, and use. Western bread is usually chewy or crusty and not very sweet. It is made with simple ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and salt, and is often eaten as a daily food or used for sandwiches. Asian bread, in contrast, includes milk, butter, eggs, and sugar, which make it light and rich. It is usually eaten as a snack or treat rather than as a main meal.</span>

        For me, bakeries are a huge part of my life. I love the experience of picking the bread off the tray.
